OpportunityHelper Overview

The `OpportunityHelper` class is designed to provide helper methods that assist in performing specific operations on Opportunities records. 
This class is intended to modularize the logic used in any Opportunity Triggers to ensure separation of concerns, improve readability, 
and ease maintenance. 

Methods:
- `setTypeProspect(SObject objects)`: 
    - Purpose: Update the 'Type' field of the given Account record to 'Prospect' if it's not already set.

- `addressCopy()`: 
    - Purpose: Copy the shipping address of the Account to its billing address.

- `setRating`: 
    - Purpose: Evaluate certain conditions on the Account and assign a rating based on that evaluation. You'll need to define the method's signature 
    and implement its logic.

- `defaultContact`: 
    - Purpose: Create a default contact related to the Account after the Account is inserted. You'll need to define the method's signature 
    and implement its logic.
